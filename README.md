# Training React app connecting to the Yelp API

Simple React app using Yelp API to display search results.
To prevent cors issues i needed to use Cors anywhere[repo](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)[demo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
